# Yet Another Expense Tracker

Yet Another Expense Tracker is yet another expense tracker built with Django to fulfill my specific use case.

It is also for trying out Heroku free tier to see if I need to host it on my own server...

Obviously there is many other frameworks and languages that I can explore but I'm already knee deep in Django which is more than enough for to quickly create this expense tracker app.
